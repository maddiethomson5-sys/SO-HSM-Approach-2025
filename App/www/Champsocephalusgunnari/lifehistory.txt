Age, growth, and longevity: short-lived species (6–7 years), reaching ~35 cm in length (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2022); Diet: feed primarily on krill, euphausiids, and mysids (Kock & Everson, 2003); Physiology and adaptations: lack hemoglobin, have enlarged hearts and increased blood volume for faster plasma circulation, sensitive to oxygen availability and adapted to stable, cold waters (Kock & Everson, 2003).
