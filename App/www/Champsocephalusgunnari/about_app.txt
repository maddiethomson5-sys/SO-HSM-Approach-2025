This application was developed to leverage available presence data for commercially and ecologically important Southern Ocean fish species to estimate and visualise habitat suitability. The Shiny app focuses on three target species—*Dissostichus eleginoides*, *Dissostichus mawsoni*, and *Champsocephalus gunnari*—providing species-specific response curves to environmental predictors and modelling potential distributions. Environmental data were obtained from Bio-ORACLE, and species occurrence records were compiled from OBIS and GBIF.
It should be noted that model outputs do not reflect observed distributions but rather indicate areas of potential environmental suitability. Presence data for Southern Ocean fish are spatially biased toward surveyed or fished regions therefore, model predictions should be interpreted with caution. The app has potential for extension to project habitat suitability under climate change scenarios and to compare current and future projections. The R code has been developed modularly over six scripts, enabling adaptation for other Southern Ocean species, provided sufficient presence data are available.
