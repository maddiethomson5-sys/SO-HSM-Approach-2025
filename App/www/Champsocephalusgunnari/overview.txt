*Champsocephalus gunnari*, or mackerel icefish, is a member of the notothenioid family Channichthyidae, notable for having little or no hemoglobin in its blood (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2022). Oxygen transport occurs via plasma solubility, a unique vertebrate adaptation (Feller & Gerday, 1997, Kock & Everson, 2003). To compensate, mackerel icefish have enlarged hearts and increased blood volume, enabling faster plasma circulation. They are benthopelagic predators feeding mainly on krill, euphausiids, and mysids (Kock & Everson, 2003). Unlike longer-lived toothfish, mackerel icefish typically live 6–7 years and reach an average adult length of 35 cm. This species is commercially important in the Southern Ocean, with fisheries mainly targeting Subarea 48.3 and Division 58.5.2 using mid- and bottom trawls, though catch limits in Area 48 have not been fully reached in recent years (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2022). <p> Mackerel icefish are endemic to the Southern Ocean, confined to island shelves of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic Peninsula (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2022). They are shelf-associated and rarely venture offshore or into deep waters. In Subarea 48.3, populations are generally restricted to shallow waters (<350 m) near South Georgia and Shag Rocks, forming large aggregations. In Subarea 58.5.2, fish are most abundant at depths under 350 m around Heard Island, with additional aggregations observed at Shell Bank (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2022). Distribution is influenced by temperature, favoring −1.0 to 3.0 °C, and by food availability. Spawning occurs nearshore in shallow waters (<200 m), where eggs are deposited on the seafloor (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2022). Larvae are strictly pelagic and can be caught in coastal areas during late winter. Similar to toothfish, juveniles gradually shift from pelagic to demersal lifestyles, but adults remain at shallower depths (30–350 m). Icefish require well-oxygenated waters due to their lack of hemoglobin and are adapted to stable, cold temperatures (Feller & Gerday, 1997)
