The Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*) is a long-lived nototheniid endemic to the Southern Ocean, characterized by sharp teeth, slow growth, and late maturity (Collins et al., 2010). Compared to the Antarctic toothfish (*D. mawsoni*), a closely related species, the Patagonian toothfish occurs further north around sub-Antarctic islands and southern South America, with some distributional overlap. Three subpopulations have been identified: Indian Ocean, South Georgia, and Patagonian Shelf (Collins et al., 2010). Adults are commercially important and targeted by longline fisheries, while juveniles are primarily caught as trawl bycatch (Collins et al., 2010). Fisheries south of the Antarctic Convergence are managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) with size limits and gear restrictions, whereas populations outside this zone are managed by national authorities (Hanchet et al., 2015). The species has not yet been assessed by the IUCN.<p> Adults show strong site fidelity, inhabiting deep waters from 500 to 3,000 m over silt, mud, seamounts, and rocky outcroppings, often near complex features such as shelf breaks and slopes (Collins et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2013). Juveniles occupy shallower demersal habitats (<300 m) on mixed sand and gravel from age one, dispersing with currents before gradually moving offshore at 6–7 years (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2023). Ontogenetic movements into deeper waters are influenced by predation risk, food availability, and reproduction. Preferred water temperatures range from 2–11 °C, with metabolism adapted to cold, high-pressure environments (Encina-Montoya et al., 2024).
