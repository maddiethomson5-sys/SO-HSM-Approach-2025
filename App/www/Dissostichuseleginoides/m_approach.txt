Habitat Suitability Models (HSMs) were developed to link presence observations of three Southern Ocean fish species with key environmental variables defining suitable habitat. A Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) model was used, with the most informative predictors identified via Spearman correlation analysis. Environmental data were sourced from Bio-ORACLE, and species occurrence records from OBIS and GBIF. To address spatial aggregation in presence-only records, kernel density estimation (KDE) was applied. Spatial autocorrelation was assessed using Moranâ€™s I, and 2-fold checkerboard spatial block cross-validation was used to split the data into training and test sets. Model performance was evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC), cutoff probability, True Skill Statistic (TSS), and Type I and Type II errors.
