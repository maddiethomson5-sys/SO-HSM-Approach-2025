Age, growth, and longevity: long-lived species, slow growth, late maturity, can reach up to 2.8 m and 50 years (Collins et al., 2010); Diet: active predators feeding on fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans, juveniles consume smaller prey while adults feed on larger individuals (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2023; Collins et al., 2010); Physiology and adaptations: antifreeze proteins enable survival at sub-zero temperatures, weakly mineralized skeleton and high muscle fat content provide neutral buoyancy (Collins et al., 2010, Seong et al., 2023).
