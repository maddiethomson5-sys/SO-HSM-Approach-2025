Closely related to the Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*), the Antarctic toothfish (*D. mawsoni*) is a benthopelagic nototheniid endemic to the Southern Ocean (SO), occurring at higher latitudes south of the Antarctic Convergence (Carimán et al., 2024). The two species overlap near this convergence, particularly north of the Ross Sea (Hanchet et al., 2015), and while similar in appearance and behaviour, they are genetically distinct. This species is adapted to extreme cold and stable SO temperatures (−1.8 to 3.0 °C). The Antarctic toothfish is commercially important and targeted with bottom longlines, with fisheries south of the Antarctic Convergence managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) under an ecosystem-based and precautionary approach (Seong et al., 2023). The species has not been assessed by the IUCN. <p> Antarctic toothfish have a circumpolar distribution along the Antarctic continental shelf and slope, exhibiting high site fidelity and limited large-scale dispersal, which reduces overlap with *D. eleginoides*. Juveniles undertake ontogenetic migrations, beginning in shallow pelagic coastal waters before shifting into deeper habitats with age (Carimán et al., 2024). Older juveniles adopt a demersal lifestyle on the continental shelf (50–300 m), subadults move to the continental slope (500–850 m), and adults settle in deep slope regions, northern banks, ridges, and seamounts by 12–16 years.
