Age, growth, and longevity: median age at maturity 13–16 years, median length at maturity ~100 cm (Carimán et al., 2024); Diet: predominantly piscivorous, diet varies geographically and shifts with life stage, with juveniles consuming smaller prey and adults targeting larger fish (Hanchet et al., 2015); Physiology and adaptations: antifreeze proteins enable survival at sub-zero temperatures, weakly mineralized skeleton and high muscle fat content provide neutral buoyancy (Collins et al., 2010, Seong et al., 2023).
