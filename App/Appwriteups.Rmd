model_info <- ("Habitat Suitability Models (HSMs) were developed to link presence observations of three Southern Ocean fish species with key environmental variables defining suitable habitat. A Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) model was used, with the most informative predictors identified via Spearman correlation analysis. Environmental data were sourced from Bio-ORACLE, and species occurrence records from OBIS and GBIF. To address spatial aggregation in presence-only records, kernel density estimation (KDE) was applied. Spatial autocorrelation was assessed using Moran’s I, and 2-fold checkerboard spatial block cross-validation was used to split the data into training and test sets. Model performance was evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC), cutoff probability, True Skill Statistic (TSS), and Type I and Type II errors.")

  "Closely related to the Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*), the Antarctic toothfish (*D. mawsoni*) is a benthopelagic nototheniid endemic to the Southern Ocean (SO), occurring at higher latitudes south of the Antarctic Convergence (Carimán et al., 2024). The two species overlap near this convergence, particularly north of the Ross Sea (Hanchet et al., 2015), and while similar in appearance and behaviour, they are genetically distinct. This species is adapted to extreme cold and stable SO temperatures (−1.8 to 3.0 °C). The Antarctic toothfish is commercially important and targeted with bottom longlines, with fisheries south of the Antarctic Convergence managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) under an ecosystem-based and precautionary approach (Seong et al., 2023). The species has not been assessed by the IUCN. <p> Antarctic toothfish have a circumpolar distribution along the Antarctic continental shelf and slope, exhibiting high site fidelity and limited large-scale dispersal, which reduces overlap with *D. eleginoides*. Juveniles undertake ontogenetic migrations, beginning in shallow pelagic coastal waters before shifting into deeper habitats with age (Carimán et al., 2024). Older juveniles adopt a demersal lifestyle on the continental shelf (50–300 m), subadults move to the continental slope (500–850 m), and adults settle in deep slope regions, northern banks, ridges, and seamounts by 12–16 years. ",
  
  "The Patagonian toothfish (*Dissostichus eleginoides*) is a long-lived nototheniid endemic to the Southern Ocean, characterized by sharp teeth, slow growth, and late maturity (Collins et al., 2010). Compared to the Antarctic toothfish (*D. mawsoni*), a closely related species, the Patagonian toothfish occurs further north around sub-Antarctic islands and southern South America, with some distributional overlap. Three subpopulations have been identified: Indian Ocean, South Georgia, and Patagonian Shelf (Collins et al., 2010). Adults are commercially important and targeted by longline fisheries, while juveniles are primarily caught as trawl bycatch (Collins et al., 2010). Fisheries south of the Antarctic Convergence are managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) with size limits and gear restrictions, whereas populations outside this zone are managed by national authorities (Hanchet et al., 2015). The species has not yet been assessed by the IUCN.<p> Adults show strong site fidelity, inhabiting deep waters from 500 to 3,000 m over silt, mud, seamounts, and rocky outcroppings, often near complex features such as shelf breaks and slopes (Collins et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2013). Juveniles occupy shallower demersal habitats (<300 m) on mixed sand and gravel from age one, dispersing with currents before gradually moving offshore at 6–7 years (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2023). Ontogenetic movements into deeper waters are influenced by predation risk, food availability, and reproduction. Preferred water temperatures range from 2–11 °C, with metabolism adapted to cold, high-pressure environments (Encina-Montoya et al., 2024).",
  
  "*Champsocephalus gunnari*, or mackerel icefish, is a member of the notothenioid family Channichthyidae, notable for having little or no hemoglobin in its blood (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2022). Oxygen transport occurs via plasma solubility, a unique vertebrate adaptation (Feller & Gerday, 1997, Kock & Everson, 2003). To compensate, mackerel icefish have enlarged hearts and increased blood volume, enabling faster plasma circulation. They are benthopelagic predators feeding mainly on krill, euphausiids, and mysids (Kock & Everson, 2003). Unlike longer-lived toothfish, mackerel icefish typically live 6–7 years and reach an average adult length of 35 cm. This species is commercially important in the Southern Ocean, with fisheries mainly targeting Subarea 48.3 and Division 58.5.2 using mid- and bottom trawls, though catch limits in Area 48 have not been fully reached in recent years (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2022). <p> Mackerel icefish are endemic to the Southern Ocean, confined to island shelves of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic Peninsula (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2022). They are shelf-associated and rarely venture offshore or into deep waters. In Subarea 48.3, populations are generally restricted to shallow waters (<350 m) near South Georgia and Shag Rocks, forming large aggregations. In Subarea 58.5.2, fish are most abundant at depths under 350 m around Heard Island, with additional aggregations observed at Shell Bank (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2022). Distribution is influenced by temperature, favoring −1.0 to 3.0 °C, and by food availability. Spawning occurs nearshore in shallow waters (<200 m), where eggs are deposited on the seafloor (CCAMLR Secretariat, 2022). Larvae are strictly pelagic and can be caught in coastal areas during late winter. Similar to toothfish, juveniles gradually shift from pelagic to demersal lifestyles, but adults remain at shallower depths (30–350 m). Icefish require well-oxygenated waters due to their lack of hemoglobin and are adapted to stable, cold temperatures (Feller & Gerday, 1997)")

about_app <- ("This application was developed to leverage available presence data for commercially and ecologically important Southern Ocean fish species to estimate and visualise habitat suitability. The Shiny app focuses on three target species—*Dissostichus eleginoides*, *Dissostichus mawsoni*, and *Champsocephalus gunnari*—providing species-specific response curves to environmental predictors and modelling potential distributions. Environmental data were obtained from Bio-ORACLE, and species occurrence records were compiled from OBIS and GBIF.
It should be noted that model outputs do not reflect observed distributions but rather indicate areas of potential environmental suitability. Presence data for Southern Ocean fish are spatially biased toward surveyed or fished regions therefore, model predictions should be interpreted with caution. The app has potential for extension to project habitat suitability under climate change scenarios and to compare current and future projections. The R code has been developed modularly over six scripts, enabling adaptation for other Southern Ocean species, provided sufficient presence data are available.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
